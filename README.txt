# Project: Live-Chat-Room
# Version: 1.00

# Description:

This is a basic live chat program that allows multiple users to talk to one another
via the UI. The base code was created by @arpanneupane19.

I plan on expanding upon this code, and combining my login/register
Flask application with this code. 
This project is a way for me to practice Flask development, linking HTML/CSS Front-End to Python Back-End,
and Live-Chat Functionailty.
